                Abstract: The assessment of climate-related economic impacts and the formulation of effective policies present significant analytical challenges. This paper explores these challenges by examining the socio-economic system's key characteristics, such as uncertainty, nonlinear shock transmission, and socio-economic tipping points, which are essential for evaluating climate impacts and devising decarbonization strategies. The study identifies the most pertinent avenues for improving diagnostic and analytical tools used in the macroeconomic evaluation of the physical impacts of climate change, as well as the risks and opportunities associated with low-carbon transition policies. Furthermore, it advocates for a collaborative approach to integrate these insights into global development strategies. These findings aim to support policymakers in addressing climate challenges and promoting sustainable development.

                Abstract: China’s stock market greatly outperformed other national markets during the first several months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it did so even before it became evident that early containment efforts would flounder in the United States and many other countries. As to why, one view holds that aggressive monetary and credit easing propped up Chinese equity values. To assess this view, we consider several interventions that eased monetary and credit conditions in the first six months of 2020. Our analysis finds clear evidence that these interventions raised implied stock market volatility but little evidence that they influenced stock price levels. We also consider policy actions that restricted short selling, limited stock sales, and boosted stock purchases. These efforts to raise net equity demand were small in scale and highly time-limited, as we discuss, suggesting that any direct effects on stock prices were also modest. Neither our study nor other work known to us provides a ready explanation for the extraordinary performance of China’s stock market in the first half of 2020. This performance is even more striking in hindsight, given later developments in China’s economy and stock market.

                Abstract: In order to keep the sustainable global developing steps and improve the innovation ability in open innovation platforms, sustainable technology catching up is indispensable in China. However, sometimes the international technology catching up paths, such as international import, FDI, and strategic alliances may not play so significant effect for laggard firms in China at their early stage of catching up on account of their weak absorptive capacity, insufficient complementary assets, and far geographical distance from advanced technologies. Therefore, how do these laggard firms expedite their early-stage sustainable technology catching up availably? Based on the extant paths, from the perspective of open innovation, we put forward a new path named learning-by-technology learning intermediary firms to help those laggard firms improve their technology catching up process and build an evolutionary economics model to capture the evolution process of this system. We gave out the technology learning intermediary firms play different roles such as technology pursuers, technology innovators, and technology transfers at different stages during the laggard firms technology catching up process.
